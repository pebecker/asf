/**
 * \page asfdoc_samd20_rtc_count_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for RTC (COUNT) - Basic
 * In this use case, the RTC is set up in count mode. The example configures the
 * RTC in 16 bit mode, with continuous updates to the COUNT register, together
 * with a set compare register value. Every 1000ms a LED on the board is
 * toggled.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_samd20_rtc_count_basic_use_case_prereq Prerequisites
 * The Generic Clock Generator for the RTC should be configured and enabled; if
 * you are using the System Clock driver, this may be done via \c conf_clocks.h.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_samd20_rtc_count_basic_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samd20_rtc_count_basic_use_case_init_code Initialization Code
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your applications \c main():
 * \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c initiate
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samd20_rtc_count_basic_use_case_main_code Add to Main
 * Add the following to your \c main().
 * \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c add_main
 *
 * \subsection rtc_count_basic_use_workflow Workflow
 * -# Create a RTC configuration structure to hold the desired RTC driver
 *    settings.
 *  \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c set_conf
 * -# Fill the configuration structure with the default driver configuration.
 *  \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *        struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *        settings.
 *
 *  \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c get_default
 * -# Alter the RTC driver configuration to run in 16-bit counting mode, with
 *    continuous counter register updates.
 *  \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c set_config
 * -# Initialize the RTC module.
 *  \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c init_rtc
 * -# Enable the RTC module, so that it may begin counting.
 *  \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c enable
 *
 * \section asfdoc_samd20_rtc_count_basic_use_case_implement Implementation
 * Code used to implement the initialized module.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samd20_rtc_count_basic_use_case_imp_code Code
 * Add after initialization in main().
 * \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c implementation_code
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samd20_rtc_count_basic_use_case_imp_workflow Workflow
 * -# Set RTC period to 2000ms (2 seconds) so that it will overflow and reset
 *    back to zero every two seconds.
 *  \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c period
 * -# Enter an infinite loop to poll the RTC driver to check when a comparison
 *    match occurs.
 *  \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c main_loop
 * -# Check if the RTC driver has found a match on compare channel 0 against the
 *    current RTC count value.
 *  \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c check_match
 * -# Once a compare match occurs, perform the desired user action.
 * \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c compare_match_action
 * -# Clear the compare match, so that future matches may occur.
 * \snippet qs_rtc_count_basic.c clear_compare_match
