 * \defgroup asfdoc_samd20_events_group SAM D20 Event System Driver (EVENTS)
 *
 * This driver for SAM D20 devices provides an interface for the configuration
 * and management of the device's peripheral event channels and users within
 * the device, including the enabling and disabling of peripheral source selection
 * and synchronization of clock domains between various modules.
 *
 * The following peripherals are used by this module:
 *
 *  - EVSYS (Event System Management)
 *
 * The outline of this documentation is as follows:
 *  - \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_prerequisites
 *  - \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview
 *  - \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_special_considerations
 *  - \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_extra_info
 *  - \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_examples
 *  - \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_api_overview
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_samd20_events_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * Peripherals within the SAM D20 devices are capable of generating two types of
 * actions in response to given stimulus; they can set a register flag for later
 * intervention by the CPU (using interrupt or polling methods), or they can
 * generate event signals which can be internally routed directly to other
 * peripherals within the device. The use of events allows for direct actions
 * to be performed in one peripheral in response to a stimulus in another
 * without CPU intervention. This can lower the overall power consumption of the
 * system if the CPU is able to remain in sleep modes for longer periods, and
 * lowers the latency of the system response.
 *
 * The event system is comprised of a number of freely configurable Event
 * Channels, plus a number of fixed Event Users. Each Event Channel can be
 * configured to select the input peripheral that will generate the events on
 * the channel, as well as the synchronization path and edge detection mode.
 * The fixed-function Event Users, connected to peripherals within the device,
 * can then subscribe to an Event Channel in a one-to-many relationship in order
 * to receive events as they are generated. An overview of the event system
 * chain is shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_fig "the figure below".
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_fig
 * \dot
 * digraph overview {
 *   rankdir=LR;
 *   node [label="Source\nPeripheral" shape=ellipse style=filled fillcolor=lightgray] src_peripheral;
 *   node [label="Event\nChannel a" shape=square style=""] event_gen0;
 *   node [label="Event\nUser x" shape=square style=""] event_user0;
 *   node [label="Event\nUser y" shape=square style=""] event_user1;
 *   node [label="Destination\nPeripheral" shape=ellipse style=filled fillcolor=lightgray] dst_peripheral0;
 *   node [label="Destination\nPeripheral" shape=ellipse style=filled fillcolor=lightgray] dst_peripheral1;
 *
 *   src_peripheral -> event_gen0;
 *   event_gen0     -> event_user0;
 *   event_gen0     -> event_user1;
 *   event_user0    -> dst_peripheral0;
 *   event_user1    -> dst_peripheral1;
 * }
 * \enddot
 *
 * There are many different events that can be routed in the device, which can
 * then trigger many different actions. For example, an Analog Comparator module
 * could be configured to generate an event when the input signal rises above
 * the compare threshold, which then triggers a Timer Counter module to capture
 * the current count value for later use.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_event_channels Event Channels
 * The Event module in each device consists of several channels, which can be
 * freely linked to an event generator (i.e. a peripheral within the device
 * that is capable of generating events). Each channel can be individually
 * configured to select the generator peripheral, signal path and edge detection
 * applied to the input event signal, before being passed to any event user(s).
 *
 * Event channels can support multiple users within the device in a standardized
 * manner; when an Event User is linked to an Event Channel, the channel will
 * automatically handshake with all attached users to ensure that all modules
 * correctly receive and acknowledge the event.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_event_users Event Users
 * Event Users are able to subscribe to an Event Channel, once it has been
 * configured. Each Event User consists of a fixed connection to one of the
 * peripherals within the device (for example, an ADC module or Timer module)
 * and is capable of being connected to a single Event Channel.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_edge_detection Edge Detection
 * For asynchronous events, edge detection on the event input is not possible,
 * and the event signal must be passed directly between the event generator and
 * event user. For synchronous and re-synchronous events, the input signal from
 * the event generator must pass through an edge detection unit, so that only
 * the rising, falling or both edges of the event signal triggers an action in
 * the event user.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_path_selection Path Selection
 * The event system in the SAM0 devices supports three signal path types from
 * the event generator to event users: asynchronous, synchronous and
 * re-synchronous events.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_path_selection_async Asynchronous Paths
 * Asynchronous event paths allow for an asynchronous connection between the
 * event generator and event user(s), when the source and destination
 * peripherals share the same \ref asfdoc_samd20_system_clock_group "Generic Clock"
 * channel. In this mode the event is propagated between the source and
 * destination directly to reduce the event latency, thus no edge detection is
 * possible. The asynchronous event chain is shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_module_async_path_fig "the figure below".
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_samd20_events_module_async_path_fig
 * \dot

 *   rankdir=LR;

 *
 *   src_peripheral -> events_chan;
 *   events_chan    -> dst_peripheral;
 *
 * }
 * \enddot
 * \note Identically shaped borders in the diagram indicate a shared generic clock channel
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_path_selection_sync Synchronous Paths
 * Synchronous event paths can be used when the source and destination
 * peripherals, as well as the generic clock to the event system itself, use
 * different generic clock channels. This case introduces additional latency in
 * the event propagation due to the addition of a synchronizer and edge detector
 * on the input event signal, however this allows modules of different clocks to
 * communicate events to one-another. The synchronous event chain is shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_module_sync_path_fig "the figure below".
 *
 * \anchor asfdoc_samd20_events_module_sync_path_fig

 *
 *   src_peripheral -> events_chan;
 *   events_chan    -> dst_peripheral;
 *
 * }
 * \enddot
 * \note Identically shaped borders in the diagram indicate a shared generic clock channel
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_samd20_events_module_overview_path_selection_resync Re-synchronous Paths
 * Re-synchronous event paths are a special form of synchronous events, where
 * the event users share the same generic clock channel as the event system
 * module itself, but the event generator does not. This reduces latency by
 * performing the synchronization across the event source and event user clock
 * domains once within the event channel itself, rather than in each event user.
 * The re-synchronous event chain is shown in
 * \ref asfdoc_samd20_events_module_resync_path_fig "the figure below".
 *
