 * \section appdoc_samd20_adc_sleepwalking_intro Introduction
 * This application demonstrates how to configure the ADC in a sleepwalking
 * operation, where the device supply voltage is measured at a fixed interval,
 * but the device is not woken from sleep  until the measured value is below
 * a given threshold; in this application 1.7 Volts.
 *
 * \section appdoc_samd20_adc_sleepwalking_setup Hardware Setup
 * An easy way to run test this application is by running it on the STK600.
 * When powering the device using the STK600 Vtarget jumper, you can control
 * the voltage generated by the STK600 from the Atmel Studio Programming dialog.
 * When changing the target voltage to a value lower than 1.7V the device will
 * start toggling a pin to signal that the low voltage condition has happened.
 * To trigger it again the device need to be reset, as the application will be
 * stuck in an infinite loop toggling the pin.
 *
 * If debugging it is also possible to start a debug session and place a
 * breakpoint in the window callback that will trigger whenever the voltage
 * has gone below the defined threshold.
 *
 * The application can easily be modified to monitor other voltages by changing
 * the input source and threshold values in the \c adc_setup function.
 *
 * \section appdoc_samd20_adc_sleepwalking_imp Implementation Details
 *
 * \subsection appdoc_samd20_adc_sleepwalking_adc ADC Configuration
 * The ADC is configured to perform hardware averaging on the measured value,
 * where the ADC will sample the signal 16 times and find the average value in
 * hardware. This smooths out high frequency noise.
 *
 * \subsection appdoc_samd20_adc_sleepwalking_rtc Sample timing
 * To trigger the ADC conversions, the RTC is setup in 32-bit counter mode,
 * clocked by the internal 32kHz oscillator divided by 32, giving a 1kHz input
 * clock. A compare value of 1000 is used to trigger the ADC conversion every
 * second.
 *
 * \subsection appdoc_samd20_adc_sleepwalking_events Event Routing
 * The Event system is setup to route the compare match interrupt from the RTC
 * to the ADC, and the ADC is configured to start a new conversion on an event
 * input. The event channel is configured as an asynchronous channel, so no
 * clock is needed for the event channel during sleep.
 *
 * \section appdoc_samd20_adc_sleepwalking_compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for ARM.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
